# CProject
This project was about computing the shortest path in a graph with MPI

##Technologies

C, MPI

##Test

To test it, I created a set of files inside the "testFiles" directory. 
I also created a script.sh to run the tests. You need to run the script inside the testFiles directory, the tests will create a new file ("var") with the results.  
The script take 1 parameter â†’ the path of the exe file of the program, here it's "brouchet" so if you are in the testFiles directory you will need to run :
> script.sh ../brouchet

Have fun.
